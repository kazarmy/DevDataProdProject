## Problem

Can use a pairs plot to do single linear regression (SLR) between all `sat.act` variables, but ...

*** =left

```{r, ref.label='pairs.plot', echo=FALSE}
```

*** =right

1. The panels are a bit small.
1. No p-values.
  
By the way, the plot was done using the following embedded R code:

```{r pairs.plot, eval=FALSE}
library(psych)
pairs.panels(sat.act, ellipses = FALSE,
             lm = TRUE)
```

## Solution

Use the sat.act SLR Explorer!
 1. Large plots.
 1. P-values (for the slope) with significance codes.

## The sat.act dataset

 - Dataset from the [SAPA project](http://sapa-project.org) and part of the R `psych` library.
 - Contains self-reported scores on the SAT Verbal (SATV), SAT Quantitative (SATQ) and ACT tests.

Some interesting observations after using the Explorer:

 1. There might be no link between education and both SAT scores, but there might be a link between education and ACT scores.
 1. Men might have a slight advantage over women on the SATQ, but not on the SATV or ACT.

Caveat (from the `sat.act` help file): The score means are higher than national norms suggesting both self selection for people taking on line personality and ability tests and a self reporting bias in scores.

Disclaimer: The observations contained in this presentation are my own and not of my
employer. This Explorer is for exploration only and not for drawing conclusions!
